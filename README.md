# TS-Service-Template

This template has the purpose of being copied as a start point for the development of other RESTful microservices with the use of `TypeScript`, it provides multiple layers of automation and a structure, so the contributions to this organization are as standard as possible. The following button will use this template for a new repo for the organization when possible.

To create new templates from this one, the `init.yml` file can be recycled, as it does a fairly general workflow, it takes every file on the `.github/variable` folder and replaces the variables `$OWNER`, `$REPO` and `$NAME` for their respective values from the new repo, `$NAME` in particular is a lowercase version of the repo's name. Finally it amends the first commit with those changes and opens a new branch to start the development.
